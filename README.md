# 🏥 Smart Healthcare Ontology

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains an ontology for **smart healthcare systems**, developed as part of the **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR)** course at the **Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique (ESI), Algiers**.  

The ontology is designed to organize and structure knowledge in intelligent healthcare, enabling interoperability, data interpretation, and decision support.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Represent knowledge for intelligent healthcare systems.
- Model patients, medical actors, devices, healthcare structures, and events.
- Enable data interpretation from IoT devices and medical sensors.
- Facilitate coordination between patients, doctors, and intelligent agents.
- Support personalized care.

---

## 🏗️ Domain Description
The ontology covers:
- **Patients**: demographic info, medical history, vital signs.  
- **Medical Actors**: doctors, specialists, nurses, AI assistants.  
- **Connected Devices**: smartwatch, oxymeter, glucometer, thermometer, tensiometer.  
- **Healthcare Structures**: hospitals, clinics, telemedicine centers, patient homes.  
- **Medical Care & Events**: consultations, hospitalizations, interventions, admissions, outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Protégé** (for ontology modeling)  
- **OWL (Web Ontology Language)**  

---

## 📂 Deliverables
- `TP_RCR_ABOUD_BOUYAKOUB_RDF.rdf` → Ontology file in RDF format.  
- `Rapport_TP_RCR_ABOUD_BOUYAKOUB.pdf` → Documentation including theory, OWL language overview, and detailed ontology description.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open `ontology.owl` in **Protégé**.  
2. Explore the classes, properties, and relationships.  
3. Validate and test using reasoning tools in Protégé.  
4. Extend or adapt the ontology to new healthcare scenarios.
